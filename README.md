# README.md

This repository hosts personal learning notes from learning Korean.

Most of the time this repo will be full of mistakes and other shortcomings.  So it is not worth other people cloning it or studying it.

The goal here is just to keep a logged record of things I need to refer back to.

## Strategy

I mainly use TTMIK (Talk To Me In Korean) but I also try multi-modal learning.
I pay for yearly subscription (https://talktomeinkorean.com).

From TTMIK I do hand-writing, speaking, and listening.

I use Apple Translate app to listen to my spoken Korean to see if it detects it correctly and translates to valid English.  The results are mostly funny translations as my speaking is not nuanced.

I also am learning how to type in Korean via a US English keyboard.

I watch Korean dramas on Netflix with Korean speech and Korean subtitles to try and catch the way of expression and how the words are sounded out.  I normally only catch the first word or the last word of a sentence because it is too fast for me.

In my personal notes, I don't put in any Romanisation of the Korean.  I watched a video that explained it is better to learn the alphabet first and then get into the rest of the learning.  So my first course was the alphabet on TTMIK.
